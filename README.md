Arduino Code for many MCU application 
=====================================


About
=====
	This section is intended to study and use, the uses of Arduino and all family range of MCU that are 'cute' in description but something to think at it when it's time to make them work. All information here will also be available in french in a final draft phase, and in nominal form simplyfied modern french...  

Preface
=======
		
	From the many Christmas were you do see a train under the tree ; There is a poke slowly turn and flash, train to pass, and all other accessories does exist since a while, but there is no big difference in the slow stepper motor from the train flasher and a lock from a vault ; and modernly see in a door lock for wifi uses ; Hopefully it exist a button to push away the motor in a jam case . It's the same thatthat do require gear to get more R.P.M. but tell you all the law for a finite gear and tell you at which speed the mcu of this moment was offering you that... But you have to read the read-track or close your eyes through the example. Imagine Emmet Brown asking ; Thus AI deduction of a spin-wheel motor to create a distorsion from copper in a center in three axes forming a fixed callabi-yau shape and read from a laser in point where the distorsion is effective. Adding we push what require to form a inherent distorsion-to worm-hole in moment ; it is slow enought to let you reach 88 miles per hours so you can get back in your so 1985 where it's apparently in stock rupture ? 
	

Description
===========

	There is work and effort in all domains it's sure all library can not do all the same things. This section will surely hosting what is not sure to allow you to leave your house after pushing your lock slide on you phone. It tell you here which library will really work because there is finite amount of trial on own we can use a thing that we should observe something good. Not as good in case explained in Preface because the guy probably left with the solution and we do read on how That train is split in execution level because here in 1985 we do missing memory ? Is not unsed but from past componnent that have merely memory of what they doing, today they are provided in low-resume state. It claim by now MCU own SRAM in convention, but even SSD does hold it's display after a disconnection.  Sometimes it's not a matter of programmation, but in event and sequence ; where some code work in [ CREATE - DO - KILL-YOURSELF - NEXT ], where all library are tested uniquely all alone and MCU is falling in panic mode by adding something else altogheter 
	   
	

Synopsis
========
	Here it's the many place, explained case from test, demonstration, exception case, roll-up plan to show a common case until it work. It's possible here as github user you will have to see the example through the 'different-brach' github allow to repository code in Version-A will demonstrate to be the skeleton, and in Version-B with N-type of modification to see the result or the exceptions. It mean it offer to see the code in branch Version-A, Version-B access. It sure in case of doubt, you can use the website of github to see by selecting at master fold-down image and show you couple of branch, 'View all branches' in case you do except to see something from a different branches. 


Definition
==========
	By definition a case, an idea are well express by case it explain and offer some alternative and do talk of the definition it self used to acheive the case and it use. Out of there is ton of posibility to make an application , but past suggest there is few memory and suggest to work in sector or in domain , so once the mcu own a ocassion to claim the memory, it process, it destroy and leave the hand. The application itself modernly own more memory so the core being bigger there is modality that switch back things and commonly create infrastructure by talking at it. Espressif owning from 512kBit to 16MBits in memory, where part are dedicated into a weak Filesystem are working well, but plugging your web-door openner like 100% of people are likely to search for still lying in the we do top-down your lock, your web and your other process added to your Wemos board to depend of some configuration and testing and sometimes a bit surprising. Like Shift Register playing better the pole distribution than ULN2003 and require only to talk about the optoisolation to help. So There is some knowledge in electronic explains in schema and images, but also come in we do have to talk about library element to find if it change the MCU or simply it's not wished.
